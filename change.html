    <h2>Some ideas of mine...</h2>
    <h3>So I had an idea...</h3>
    <p>A point-based reward system</p>
    <h5>And here's how it works...</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>You get points (or lose points) by doing different things:</li>
        <li>You purchase an item +1 for each</li>
        <li>You make an order higher than $20 +10 extra</li>
        <li>You supply us with new items (more on this later) +5 for each item fufilled</li>
        <li>You make it into a team (working with us) + 100 One-time</li>
        <li>You are an original member +&#8734;</li>
        <li>You are the head of a team +250 Until you are not</li>
        <li>You are CEO +&#8734;</li>
        <li><strong>UNFORTUNALLY, YOU CAN ALSO LOST POINTS:</strong></li>
        <li>You have been warned once -10</li>
        <li>You have been warnd 2 times - 50</li>
        <li>You have been banned -10&#215;banned time (days)</li>
        <li>You have not fufilled orders -50 each time</li>
        <li>You have not bought money on due date -20 + order cancelled</li>
        <li>Leaving/Backing out -Bonus that you got</li>
        <li>You have caused 3 errors in a day (web-sensed) -10</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What you can do with points:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>50 Points: 10&#162; off most items</li>
        <li>100 Points: 10-25% off most items</li>
        <li>200 Points: 26-50% off most items</li>
        <li>400 Points: 50-75% off most items</li>
        <li>500 Points: <i>Sometimes</i> free items (unless you work with us)</li>
        <li>750 Points: Have access to web code (you can edit)</li>
        <li>1000 Points: You can get a sample everytime a new item is added</li>
    </ul>
